# Tesseract Testing

Exploring how to use Tesseract and Pytesseract before building them into the functionality of my  File Storage Database project for the Cazenovia Lake Association.

To set up, [install Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html), then create a virtualenv and activate it, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run: `python convert.py -i "path/to/file.pdf"`
